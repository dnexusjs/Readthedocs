# Plugins

DiscordNexus can be extended and customized with plugins.

Plugins are 'extensions' that you can add to your program to enhance performance and functionality. We deliver new features without you having to code from scratch. Similar to adding extras to a movie to add to the story, plugins are a way to add new features to your program.
